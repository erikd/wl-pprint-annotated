[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/minad/wl-pprint-annotated.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/minad/wl-pprint-annotated)

This is a limited version of wl-pprint-extras by @ekmett without support for point effects and without the free monad.
Like in annotated-wl-pprint, only annotations are supported. Compared to annotated-wl-pprint this library provides a slightly modernized interface.
